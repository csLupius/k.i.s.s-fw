  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
